Some clinical studies found these effects to be partially additive to the effects of thiazide diuretics. Amiloride exerts its potassium-sparing effect by inhibiting Na reabsorption at the distal renal tubules; this decreases the net -ve potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both K and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It reduces electrolyte reabsorption from the renal tubules. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of Na and chloride in approx equiv amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of K and bicarbonate. It exerts its hypotensive effect partly by reducing peripheral resistance., \tAdditive effects with other antihypertensives. May increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. May reduce arterial responsiveness to pressor amines e.g. norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension may occur with alcohol, barbiturates and narcotics. Discontinue diuretics 2-3 days before initiation of an ACE inhibitor to reduce the likelihood of 1st dose hypotension. Increased hypokalaemia with corticosteroids or ACTH.

Discard any unused portion.,Protein supply for parenteral nutrition. Prophylaxis & therapy of protein deficiency resulting from increased protein losses &/or increased protein requirements.,Contraindicated in patients with inborn errors of amino acids metabolism. Moreover, amino acid should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.,Adults:\n\nThe nitrogen requirement for maintenance of body protein mass depends on the patient's condition (nutritional state and degree of metabolic stress).\nNo or minor metabolic stress and normal nutritional state: 0.10-0.15 g nitrogen/kg/day,\nModerate metabolic stress with or without malnutrition: 0.15-0.20 g nitrogen/kg/day,\nSevere catabolism as in burns, sepsis and trauma: up to 0.20-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day.\n\nThe dosage range 0.10-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day corresponds to 15-35 ml amino acid IV/kg/day.\nIn obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml amino acid may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. It should be infused slowly, at rates 1.4-2.8 ml (30-60 drops) per minute.\n\nInfants and Children:\nIn children and infants, the rate of infusion is 28-35 ml/kg body wt/day is recommended, with a stepwise increment in the rate of administration during the first week of treatment.,It is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and sweating have been observed during infusion of amino acid IV at rates exceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Like all hypertonic infusion solution, thrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The incidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10% fat emulsion. If it is infused to severely ill patients, premature infants, hyperphenylalaninemia may occur.,3,A crystalline amino acid solution provides crystalline amino acids to promote protein synthesis and wound healing, and to reduce the rate of endogenous protein catabolism.

54,Amino Acids 7 % + Glucose & Electrolytes 10 %,Special care must be taken when administering glucose solutions to provide calories in diabetic or prediabetic patients. To control and minimize possible hyperglycemia and consequent glycosuria, it is desirable to monitor blood and urine glucose and, if necessary, add insulin.\n\nBecause of its antianabolic activity, concurrent administration of tetracycline may reduce the nitrogen sparing effects of infused amino acids.\n\nFeeding regimens which include amino acids should be used with caution in patients with history of renal disease, pulmonary disease, or with cardiac insufficiency so as to avoid excessive fluid accumulation.\n\nNitrogen intake should be carefully monitored in patients with impaired renal function.,Prevent nitrogen loss, Negative nitrogen balance, Nutritional therapy,This preparation should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.,For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism. Infusion or ingestion of carbohydrate or lipid will not reduce the nitrogen sparing effect of intravenous amino acid infusions at this dose.\nAs with all intravenous fluid therapy, the primary aim is to provide sufficient water to compensate for insensible, urinary, and other fluid losses (nasogastric suction, fistula drainage, and diarrhea).  Infused at a rate of 45 mL/kg/day, will meet the fluid and amino acid requirements of the stable adult patient.\nAs reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia., it can be infused through a peripheral vein paying great care to the possible occurrence of local reactions. Local reactions consisting of a warm sensation, erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids; in such cases the infusion site should be changed promptly to another vein. Use of large peripheral veins, inline filters, and slower rates of infusion may reduce the incidence of local venous irritation. Electrolyte additives should be spread throughout the day. Irritating additive medications may need to be injected at another venous site.\n\nGeneralized flushing, fever and nausea have been reported during peripheral infusions of amino acid solutions.,3,A crystalline amino acid solution provides crystalline amino acids to promote protein synthesis and wound healing, and to reduce the rate of endogenous protein catabolism.

Essential water and salts are lost in stools and vomitus, and dehydration results when blood volume is decreased because of fluid loss from the extracellular fluid compartment. Preservation of the facilitated glucose-sodium cotransport system in the small-bowel mucosa is the rationale of oral rehydration therapy. Glucose is actively absorbed in the normal intestine and carries sodium with it in about an equimolar ration. Therefore, there is a greater net absorption of an isotonic salt solution with glucose than one without it. Potassium replacement during acute diarrhoea prevents below-normal serum concentrations of potassium, especially in children, in whom stool potassium losses are higher than in adults. Bicarbonates are effective in correcting the metabolic acidosis caused by diarrhoea and dehydration.,NULL

Oxybenzone can be considered a broad-spectrum absorber. It significantly augments UV-B protection when used in a given formula. \nAvobenzone\nOften referred to by its trade name, Parsol 1789, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane or avobenzone provides superior protection through a large portion of the UV-A range, including UV-A I. A significant addition to sunscreen products for true broad-spectrum UV protection, concerns have been raised regarding its photostability and its potential to degrade other sunscreen ingredients in products in which it is used. \nTitanium dioxide\nThe ideal sunscreen agent would be chemically inert, safe, and absorb or reflect through the full UV spectrum. Titanium dioxide meets these criteria limited only by aesthetics. By decreasing the particle size of this pigment to microsize or ultrafine grades, thereby making it less visible on the skin surface, some of these advantages could be used. This ingredient can be classified as a broad-spectrum agent. \nPadimate O\nPadimate O is the most potent UV-B absorber.\n,NULL

500,Dextran 70 6% + Dextrose 5%,The possibility of circulatory overload should be kept in mind. Special care should be exercised in patients with impaired renal clearance of dextran. When the risk of pulmonary edema and/or congestive heart failure may be increased, dextran should be used with caution.\n\nIn patients with normal hemostasis, dosage of LMD (dextran 40) approximating 15 mL/kg of body weight may prolong bleeding time and depress platelet function. Dosages in this range also markedly decrease factor VIII, and decrease factors V and IX to a greater degree than would be expected to occur from hemodilution alone. Since these changes tend to be more pronounced following trauma or major surgery, patients should be observed for early signs of bleeding complications.\n\nSince increased rouleaux formation may occur in the presence of dextran, it is recommended that blood samples be drawn for typing and cross-matching prior to the infusion of dextran and reserved for subsequent use if necessary. If blood is drawn after infusion of dextran, the saline agglutination and indirect antiglobulin methods may be used for typing and cross-matching. Difficulty may be encountered when proteolytic enzyme techniques are used to match blood.\n\nConsideration should be given to withdrawal of blood for chemical laboratory tests prior to initiating therapy with dextran because of the following:\n\n    Blood sugar determinations that employ high concentrations of acid may result in hydrolysis of dextran, yielding falsely elevated glucose assay results. This has been observed both with sulfuric acid and with acetic acid.\n\n    In other laboratory tests, the presence of dextran in the blood may result in the development of turbidity, which can interfere with the assay. This has been observed in bilirubin assays in which alcohol is employed and in total protein assays employing biuret reagent.\n\nSolutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.\n\nCaution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.\n\nDo not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. ,Hypovolaemic shock, Pulmonary embolism, Venous thrombosis, Open heart surgery,Patients with known hypersensitivity to dextran, in those with marked hemostatic defects of all types (thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, etc.) including those caused by drugs (heparin, warfarin, etc.), marked cardiac decompensation and in renal disease with severe oliguria or anuria.,DextranI/V should be administered prior to administration of clinical dextran solutions.\n\n    In shock, it is suggested that total dosage not exceed 20 mL/kg for adults and adolescents, during the first 24 hours. The first 10 mL/kg may be infused as rapidly as necessary to effect improvement. It is strongly recommended that central venous pressure be monitored frequently during the initial infusion of the drug. Should therapy continue beyond 24 hours, subsequent dosage should not exceed 10 mL/kg per day and therapy should not continue beyond five days.\n\n  In prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, the dosage  for adults and adolescents, should be chosen according to the risk of thromboembolic complications, e.g., type of surgery and duration of immobilization. In general, treatment should be initiated during surgery; 500 to 1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg of body weight) should be administered on the day of operation. Treatment should be continued at a dose of 500 mL daily for an additional two to three days; then, according to the risk of complications, 500 mL may be given every second or third day during the period of risk, for up to two weeks.\n\n    Infants may be given 5 mL per kg body weight and children 10 mL per kg.\n\n,Because of the seriousness of anaphylactoid reactions, it is recommended that the infusion of intravenous dextran be stopped at the first sign of an allergic reaction provided that other means of sustaining the circulation are available. Resuscitative measures should be readily available for emergency administration in the event such a reaction occurs. In circulatory collapse due to anaphylaxis, rapid volume substitutions with an agent other than dextran should be instituted.,3,Dextrans produce expansion of plasma volume. It also reduces blood viscosity and inhibits sludging or aggregation of red blood cells.,Dextran: Enzyme inducers e.g. phenytoin or carbamazepine and enzyme inhibitors e.g. cimetidine.

General management recommendations are also provided as applicable. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.,4,Everolimus, a proliferation signal inhibitor, prevents allograft rejection in rodent and nonhuman primate models of allotransplantation. It exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the proliferation and thus, clonal expansion, of antigen-activated T cells which is driven by T cell-specific interleukins eg, interleukin-2 and interleukin-15. Everolimus inhibits an intracellular signaling pathway that normally leads to cell proliferation when triggered by the binding of these T cell growth factors to their receptors. The blockage of this signal by everolimus causes cells to be arrested at the G1 stage of the cell cycle.\n\nAt the molecular level, everolimus forms a complex with the cytoplasmic protein FKBP-12. In the presence of everolimus, the growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase is inhibited. Since p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation is under the control of FRAP (also called m-TOR), this finding suggests that the everolimus-FKBP-12 complex binds to and thus, interferes with the function of FRAP. FRAP is a key regulatory protein which governs cell metabolism, growth and proliferation; disabling FRAP function thus explains the cell cycle arrest caused by everolimus.,CYP3A4 inhibitors &/or inducers, CYP2D6 substrates w/ narrow therapeutic index, PgP inhibitors, rifampicin, ACE inhibitors, grapefruit juice & live vaccines.

752,Glimepiride + Pioglitazone,Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when  is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of  must be considered ,Type 2 DM,    Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure \n\n    Use in patients with known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone, glimepiride or any other component. \n\n    Use in patients with known history of an allergic reaction to sulfonamide derivatives. , \tOral\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nAdult: Each tab contains pioglitazone 15 mg or 30 mg and glimepiride 2 mg or 4 mg: Initially, 1 tab once daily then titrate gradually as needed.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,,    Congestive Heart Failure \n    Hypoglycemia \n\n    Edema \n\n    Fractures\n\n    Hemolytic Anemia ,3,Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, reduces blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin w/o increasing pancreatic insulin secretion and is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity. Glimepiride, a sulfonylurea, stimulates insulin release from the pancreatic beta-cells. It also reduces glucose output from the liver and increases insulin sensitivity at peripheral target sites.,Increased plasma levels w/ CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole). Decreased plasma levels w/ CYP2C8 inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Colesevelam may reduce the max plasma concentration and total exposure of glimepiride. Concominant use w/ oral miconazole may lead to severe hypoglycaemia.
753,Glimepiride + Rosiglitazone,Hypoglycemia: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary\n, renal, or hepatic insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose lowering drugs.\nLoss of Control of Blood Glucose:\nWhen a patient stabilized on any antidiabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a temporary loss of glycemic control may occur.\n\nEdema:\nCombination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema.\nSince thiazolidinediones, including Rosiglitazone can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, Combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for heart failure.\nWeight Gain:\nDose-related weight gain was seen with Rosiglitazone alone and in combination with other hypoglycemic agents. \nHepatic Effects:\nLiver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical\njudgment of the healthcare professional. ,Type 2 DM,Patients with established Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated.,The usual starting dose of 1mg/4 mg or 2 mg/4 mg once daily.\nThe maximum recommended daily dose of is 4 mg of Glimepiride and 8 mg of Rosiglitazone.\nThe dosage of anti-diabetic therapy should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability. \n,Hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, nausea, allergic skin reactions, e.g., pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions.\n\nRosiglitazone:The mostcommon adverse experiences with Rosiglitazone are upper\nrespiratory tract infection, injury, and headache. Events of anemia and edema tended to be reported more frequently at higher doses, angioedema and urticaria have been reported rarely.\n,3, Glimepiride: Initial effect to increase insulin secretion from beta cells; may also decrease rate of hepatic glucose production and increase insulin receptor sensitivity.\n\nRosiglitazone: Lowers glucose by improving target cell response to insulin without increasing pancreatic cell secretion; activates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which influences the production of gene products involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.,Glimepiride: Salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, coumarin anticoagulants, probenecid, CYP2C9 inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, disopyramide, fluoxetine, quinolones, ACE inhibitors, MAOIs and ?-blockers may potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride. Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, oestrogens, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics and CYP2C9 inducers may reduce hypoglycaemic effect of glimepiride. Reduced plasma concentration w/ colesevelam.\n\nRosiglitazone: Increased plasma conc w/ gemfibrozil. Decreased plasma conc w/ rifampicin.\n\n

813,Imipramine Hydrochloride,Imipramine should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Imipramine may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.,Depression,Nocturnal enuresis,Imipramine should not be given in conjunction with, or within 14 days of treatment with a MAO inhibitor.

Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following a myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma. ,Depression, initially up to 75 mg daily in divided doses increased gradually to 150-200 mg (up to 300 mg in hospital patients); up to 150 mg may be given as a single dose at bedtime; elderly initially 10 mg daily, increased gradually to 30-50 mg daily; child not recommended for depression.\nNocturnal enuresis, child 7-8 years 25 mg, 8-11 years 25-50 mg, over 11 years 50-75 mg at bedtime; max. period of treatment (including gradual withdrawal) 3 months-full physical examination before further course.,The most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Imipramine usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion, disorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking imipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness), seizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported.

Patients may experience a metallic taste and there may be weight loss, which in some diabetics could be an advantage.,2,Metformin is a biguanide w/ antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It decreases hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis; delays intestinal absorption of glucose; and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation.,Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.
976,Metformin Hydrochloride + Pioglitazone,Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases.\n\nMetformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive this combination.,Type 2 DM,1. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl in male, >1.4 mg/dl in females or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.\n2.

It should not be initiated if the patients exhibit clinical evidence of active liver disease. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter. ,Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.,13,Pioglitazone is as a potent and highly selective agonist for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma. Activation of these receptors promotes the production of gene products involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. It also improves insulin response to target cells witho increasing the pancreatic secretion of insulin. Metformin decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity (increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation).,Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.
977,Metformin Hydrochloride + Rosiglitazone,Rosiglitazone: should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. This should be used with caution in patients with edema. Dose-related weight gain was seen with rosiglitazone alone and rosiglitazone together with other hypoglycemic agents.\n\nMetformin: Monitoring of renal function: Patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive this tablet. In patients with advanced age, the dose should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. ,Type 2 DM,It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine levels .1.5 mg/dl (males), 1.4 mg/dl (females), or abnormal creatinine clearance), acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma & known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone maleate or metformin HCl.,The dosage  should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 8mg/2000 mg (Rosiglitazone/Metformin).\n\n In Drug-Naive Patients: The recommended starting dose of  is 2 mg/500 mg once or twice daily. \n\nFor patients with HbA1c >11% or FPG>270 mg/dL, a starting dose of 2 mg/500 mg twice daily may be considered. The dose may be increased by increment of 2 mg/500 mg per day to a maximum of 8 mg/2,000 mg per day in divided doses if patients are not adequately controlled after 4 weeks.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy, the usual starting dose  is 4 mg Rosiglitazone (daily dose) plus the dose of Metformin already being taken.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on Rosiglitazone monotherapy, the usual starting dose is 1000 mg Metformin (daily dose) plus the dose of Rosiglitazone already being taken.\n\nWhen switching from combination therapy of Rosiglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets, the usual starting dose  is the dose of Rosiglitazone and Metformin already being taken. If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose may be increased by increment of 4 mg Rosiglitazone and/or 500 mg Metformin, up to the maximum recommended total daily dose of 8 mg/2000 mg.,Rosiglitazone: The commonly reported adverse events are upper respiratory tract infections, injury, headache, back pain, fatigue, sinusitis, diarrhoea and hypoglycemia. There were a small number of patients who had anemia and edema. All these events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment with Rosiglitazone.\nMetformin: Some patients may develop asymptomatic subnormal levels of serum vitamin B12.\nIncidence of lactic acidosis is also very rare. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence and anorexia are common reactions to Metformin.,13,Rosiglitazone: Lowers glucose by improving target cell response to insulin without increasing pancreatic cell secretion; activates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which influences the production of gene products involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.\n\nMetformin: Biguanide; acts by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization; improves glucose tolerance and lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .,Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.
978,Metformin Hydrochloride + Sitagliptin,Do not use the combination of Sitagliptin & Metformin in patients with hepatic disease. Before initiating the combination and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function and verify as normal.

984,Methylprednisolone Acetate,General\n\nThe lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.\n\nSince complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.\n\nKarposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.,Cardiac arrest, Multiple sclerosis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Acute bronchitis, Vestibular neuritis,Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents.\n\nIntramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nMethylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route.\n\nMethylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions,The initial dosage of parenterally administered Methyl Prednisolone Acetate will vary from 4 to 120 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.\n\nIt Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\n\nA. Administration for Local Effect\n\n1. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis. The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:\n\nLarge Joint: Knees, Ankles & Shoulders:\t20 to 80 mg\nMedium joint: Elbows & Wrists:\t 10 to 40 mg\nSmall joint:  Metacarpophalangeal, Interphalangeal, Sternoclavicular & Acromioclavicular:  4 to 10 mg\n\n2. The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.\n\n3. Injections for Local Effect in Dermatologic Conditions. Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. \n\nB. Administration for Systemic Effect\n\nThe intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.\n\nIn pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.\n\nIn patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.\n\nFollowing intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.\n\nIf signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.\n\nIn treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\n,The following adverse reactions have been reported with methylprednisolone acetate or other corticosteroids:\n\nAllergic Reactions\n\nAllergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema.\n\nCardiovascular\n\nBradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, circulatory collapse, congestive heart failure, fat embolism, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopthy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent mycocardial infarction , pulmonary edema, syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis.\n\nDermatologic\n\nAcne, allergic dermatitis, cutaneous and subcutaneous atrophy, dry scaly skin, ecchymoses and petechiae, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, impaired wound healing, increase sweating, rash, sterile abscess, striae, suppressed reactions to skin tests, thin fragile skin, thinning scalp hair, urticaria.\n\nEndocrine\n\nDecreased carbohydrate and glucose tolerance, development of cushingoid state, glycosuria, hirsutism, hypertrichosis, increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetes, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, menstrual irregularities, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness (particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery, or illness), suppression of growth in pediatric patients.\n\nFluid and Electrolyte Disturbances\n\nCongestive heart failure in susceptible patients, Fluid retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, potassium loss, sodium retention.\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nAbdominal distention, bowel/bladder dysfunction (after intrathecal administration), elevation in serum liver enzymes levels (usually reversible upon discontinuation), hepatomegaly, increased appetite, nausea, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer with possible subsequent perforation and hemorrhage, perforation of the small and large intestine (particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative esophagitis.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nAseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, calcinosis (following intra-articular or intra-lesional use), Charcot-like arthropathy, loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, pathologic fracture of long bones, postinjection flare (following intra-articular use), steroid myopathy, tendon rupture, vertebral compression fractures.\n\nNeurologic/Psychiatric\n\nConvulsions, depression, emotional instability, euphoria, headache, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri) usually following discontinuation of treatment, insomnia, mood swings, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, personality changes, psychic disorders, vertigo.\n\nOphthalmic\n\nExophthalmoses, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts.\n\n\n\n,3,Methylprednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity and minimal mineralocorticoid properties.

Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route. Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions,This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.\n\nWhen high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours.\n\nIn general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.\n\nIn other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.\n\nIt should be emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. \nIf after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\n\nTo prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. This solution may then be added to indicate amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution.\n\nIn pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.\n\nDosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.\n\nIn treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\n,The following adverse reactions have been reported with methylprednisolone acetate or other corticosteroids: Allergic Reactions Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema.

1050,Niacin (nicotinic acid),Before instituting therapy with Niacin, an attempt should be made to control hyperlipidemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients and to treat other underlying medical problems. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during Niacin therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.\n\nCaution should also be used when Niacin is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with Niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count and increases in prothrombin time. Caution should be observed when Niacin is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time and platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). So phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk.,Ischaemic events, Hyperlipidaemias, Nicotinic acid deficiency,Niacin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Niacin or any component of this medication, significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction, active peptic ulcer disease or arterial bleeding.,Oral\nTreatment and prophylaxis of nicotinic acid deficiency\nAdult: Up to 500 mg daily in divided doses.

It combines with heparin to form a stable inactive complex. Protamine sulfate is often used in the treatment of bleeding from severe heparin overdose and should not be used in minor overdose/bleeding as heparin withdrawal will usually correct itself within a few hr. For LMWH, protamine sulfate neutralises the anti-thrombin activity but only partly neutralises the anti-factor-Xa effect. When admin in the absence of heparin, protamine sulfate has an anticoagulant effect. Protamine is not useful for reversing the effects of oral anticoagulants.,NULL

As with other alpha-blockers, drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth or oedema can occur. Syncope has been reported rarely, and there have been very rare reports of angioedema and priapism.,2,Tamsulosin is a selective ?1 adrenoreceptor-blocking agent. Smooth muscle tone is mediated by the sympathetic nervous stimulation of ?1 adrenoreceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and reduction in symptoms in BPH.,Increased plasma concentration w/ strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole).

Wash affected areas well, rinse off all traces of soap, dry, and apply sparingly twice daily.,May produce local irritations (including erythema, burning or pruritus) and oedema when applied to sensitive, moist or fissured skin.,3,Urea is an osmotic diuretic similar to mannitol but more irritant. It induces diuresis by increasing osmotic pressure of the glomerular filtrate and increasing excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride ions. Its osmotic effect also draws water from cells e.g. brain, CSF and anterior chamber of the eye, thereby decreasing intracranial or intraocular pressure. Unlike mannitol, urea penetrates the eye and causes a rebound increase in intraocular pressure if the plasma concentration of the drug is less than that in the vitreous humour. Applied topically, urea promotes hydration of keratin and mild keratolysis in dry skin. It increases water uptake by the stratum corneum and has an antipruritic effect.,Increased excretion of lithium.

In these patients, monitoring of the phenylalanine levels is recommended and the infusion rate adjusted as needed. Do not use if the solution is turbid or contains particles. Discard any unused portion.,Parenteral nutrition,contraindicated in patients with inborn errors of amino acids metabolism. Moreover, amino acid should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.,Adults: The nitrogen requirement for maintenance of body protein mass depends on the patient's condition (nutritional state and degree of metabolic stress). No or minor metabolic stress and normal nutritional state: 0.10-0.15 g nitrogen/kg/day, Moderate metabolic stress with or without malnutrition: 0.15-0.20 g nitrogen/kg/day, Severe catabolism as in burns, sepsis and trauma: up to 0.20-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day. The dosage range 0.10-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day corresponds to 15-35 ml amino acid IV/kg/day. In obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml amino acid may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. It should be infused slowly, at rates 1.4-2.8 ml (30-60 drops) per minute. Infants and Children: In children and infants, the rate of infusion is 28-35 ml/kg body wt/day is recommended, with a stepwise increment in the rate of administration during the first week of treatment.,It is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and sweating have been observed during infusion of amino acid IV at rates exceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Like all hypertonic infusion solution, thrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The incidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10% fat emulsion. If it is infused to severely ill patients, premature infants, hyperphenylalaninemia may occur.,3,Provides nutritional requirements that support neurotransmitter synthesis and physiological activities involved in neuropathic pain; helps restore nutrient balance of arginine, choline, glutamine, histidine, tryptophan, and serine which support the balance of the neurotransmitters GABA, histamine, nitric oxide, serotonin, and acetylcholine\n\nUnder usual physiological conditions, glutamine, arginine, serine, and choline are considered nonessential because endogenous synthesis is sufficient to satisfy metabolic demand; with neuropathic pain, the usual rate of synthesis is no longer sufficient and these nutrients become conditionally essential, requiring that supplemental amounts be consumed.,NULL

1891,Human 1gG Proteins with Rabies,Administered intravenously at a rate that will permit observation of the patient for any immediate reaction. Rates of infusion of up to 225 IU per minute have been regularly tolerated with no adverse reactions. If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration   , the rate of infusion should be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient. The infusion should be stopped promptly and appropriate countermeasures and supportive therapy should be administered should evidence of an acute hypersensitivity reaction be observed. Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene may be at increased risk for inhibitor formation and acute hypersensitivity reactions.,Postexposure prophylaxis of Rabies,Known history of allergic symptoms to horse proteins.,Recommended Dose: Adults and Children: 40 IU/kg of body weight. However, for children, particularly in the case of multiple wounds, it has been proposed to dilute the dose 2-3 times in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution to obtain a sufficient quantity of equine rabies immune globulin to infiltrate the wound(s) correctly.\n\nIt must be injected slowly by the IM route.\nIf anatomically feasible, as much as possible of the dose should be infiltrated around and into the wounds. The remainder of the dose should be administered IM (into the gluteal region) in a single injection.\n\nAs a general rule, 1 IU of Factor IX activity per kg can be expected to increase the circulating level of Factor IX by 1% [IU/dL] of normal.,Do not administer the vaccine IV due to the risk of shock ie, sudden collapse with drop in blood pressure. ,3,Rabies immunoglobulins provide passive immunity to rabies. 2 types of immunoglobulin are available namely, human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) and purified equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG).

1895,Tetanus (Human Anti-tetanus) Immunoglobulin,Intravenous injection of immunoglobulin intended for intramuscular use can, on occasion, cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure, and a picture not unlike anaphylaxis. Injections should only be made intramuscularly and care should be taken to draw back on the plunger of the syringe before injection in order to be certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel. Intramuscular injections are preferably administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.\n\nChemoprophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical nor useful in managing wounds. Wound cleaning, debridement when indicated, and proper immunization are important. The need for tetanus toxoid (active immunization), with or without TIG (passive immunization), depends on both the condition of the wound and the patient’s vaccination history. Rarely has tetanus occurred among persons with documentation of having received a primary series of toxoid injections.,Passive immunisation against Tetanus,Hypersensitivity homologous Ig-containing medicinal products particularly in patients w/ IgA deficiency & concurrent presence of Ab to IgA.,Adults and children 7 years and older: 250 units(1 ml) should be given by deep intramuscular injection . \nAt the same time, but in a different extremity and with a separate syringe, active immunization with adsorved tetanus vaccine should be administered. \n\nChildren less than 7 years old: In small children the routine prophylactic dose  may be calculated by the body weight (4.0 units/kg). ,Slight soreness at the site of injection and slight temperature elevation may be noted at times. Sensitization to repeated injections of human immunoglobulin is extremely rare.\n\nIn the course of routine injections of large numbers of persons with immunoglobulin there have been a few isolated occurrences of angioneurotic edema, nephrotic syndrome, and anaphylactic shock after injection.,3,Tetanus immunoglobulin is used for passive immunisation against tetanus.,May reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.
1906,Human Papilloma virus Bivalent (Types 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant,Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of Cervarix.\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Cervarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection eg, a cold should not result in the deferral of vaccination.\nUse in lactation: The effect on breastfed infants of the administration of Cervarix to their mothers has not been evaluated in clinical studies.\nCervarix should only be used during breastfeeding when the possible advantages outweigh the possible risks.\nSerological data suggest a transfer of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies via the milk during the lactation period in rats. However, it is unknown whether vaccine-induced antibodies are excreted in human breast milk.,Human Papillomavirus infection, Premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer, Adenocarcinoma in situ, Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,Known hypersensitivity to any component. ,Intramuscular\nAdult: Females 10-25 yr (or between 10-45 yr in some countries): 3 doses of 0.5 mL each  given at 0, 1 and 6 mth, preferably administered into deltoid muscle.\nChild: Not recommended for use in girls below 10 yr of age.,The most common reaction observed after vaccine administration was injection site pain, which occurred after 78% of all doses.

HPV bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine is a non-infectious vaccine produced by recombinant technology, which contains virus-like particles (VLP) of the major capsid L1 protein of oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. Efficacy of vaccine may be mediated by the production of IgG neutralizing antibodies against the HPV-L1 capsid proteins.,Immunosuppressive therapies e.g. irradiation, cytotoxic drugs and corticorsteroids may reduce a patient's immune response to the vaccine.
1909,Human Rota Virus, Live attenuated Vaccine,It is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. Parents/guardians should be advised to seek medical advice promptly where these signs/symptoms are evident. There is a potential risk for transmission to non-vaccinated contacts. It should be administered with caution to infants with close contacts who are immunodeficient, such as household members with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Contacts of recent vaccinees should be advised to observe personal hygiene (e.g. washing their hands when changing childrenâ€™s nappies).,Prevention of Rotavirus diarrhea,Subjects with history of intussusception. Subjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for immunisation.,The vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose should be given between 6 and 14 weeks of age. The interval between the two doses should not be less than 4 weeks. The vaccine course should be completed by the age of 24 weeks as safety has not been assessed in older children. In clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such circumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit.,Risk of intussusception has not been established. The overall incidence of intussusception remains rare.,3,Rotavirus is one of the important causes of severe acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children. There are 2 commercially available forms of rotavirus vaccine. Rotarix®: A live, attenuated monovalent vaccine derived from human strain indicated for prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1, G3, G4 and G9 serotypes; RotaTeq® as a live, pentavalent human-bovine reassortant vaccine indicated for prevention of gastreoenteritis caused by rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3 and G4. Although presence of porcine cirovirus (PCV1 and PCV2) DNA have been detected in the rotavirus vaccine, current available information shows that there is no evidence that PCV1 or PCV2 poses a safety risk to humans. Exact immunologic mechanism of action is not fully understood although it is known that vaccine viruses replicate in the small intestine and promote active immunity.,NULL

2080,Liraglutide,In the clinical trials, there have been 6 reported cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia among Victoza-treated patients and 2 cases in comparator-treated patients (1.3 vs. 1.0 cases per 1000 patient-years). One comparator-treated patient with MTC had pre-treatment serum calcitonin concentrations >1000 ng/L suggesting pre-existing disease. All of these cases were diagnosed after thyroidectomy, which was prompted by abnormal results on routine, protocol-specified measurements of serum calcitonin. Five of the six Victoza-treated patients had elevated calcitonin concentrations at baseline and throughout the trial. One Victoza and one non-Victoza-treated patient developed elevated calcitonin concentrations while on treatment. ,Type 2 diabetes,Do not use in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).\n\nDo not use in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to   any of the product components.,It can be administered once daily at any time of day, independently of meals, and can be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment.\n\nFor all patients  should be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg per day for one week. The 0.6 mg dose is a starting dose intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms during initial titration, and is not effective for glycemic control. After one week at 0.6 mg per day, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. If the 1.2 mg dose does not result in acceptable glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg.\n\nWhen initiating , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia,Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.,3,Incretin mimetic; analogue of human glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1); acts as GLP-1 receptor agonist to increase insulin secretion in the presence of elevated blood glucose; delays gastric emptying to decrease postprandial glucose; also decreases glucagon secretion.,Oral Contraceptives: Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 hrs with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of either ethinyloestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide.\n\nWarfarin: No interaction study has been performed. Upon initiation of Liraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin more frequent monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) is recommended.\n\nInsulin: Combination of Liraglutide with insulin has not been evaluated.\n\nIncompatibilities: Substances added to Liraglutide may cause degradation of liraglutide. In the absence of compatibility studies, Liraglutide must not be mixed with other medicinal products.

Carbidopa increases the amount of levodopa that is transported into the CNS by inhibiting the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Entacapone is a selective inhibitor of catechol-o-methyltransferase. Given concurrently, entacapone results in greater and more substained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to greater control of parkinsonism symptoms.,Increased risk of postural hypotension when used concurrently with hypotensive drugs. Severe orthostatic hypotension may result from concurrent usage with MAOIs. Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, phenytoin or papaverine may reduce the efficacy of levodopa. Iron salts may reduce the bioavailability. Concurrent usage with drugs that interfere with biliary excretion may lead to increased plasma levels of entacapone.

2130,Menotrophin 75 IU FSH + 75 IU LH,hCG should not be administered to induce ovulation in females whose ovaries have unintentionally been hyperstimulated.\nWhen treating sterile women, ovarian activity should be checked (ultrasound and estradiol levels in serum response) prior to HMG administration. During treatment, these tests should be carried out every 1-2 days until stimulation occurs. Ovarian reaction can also be measured using a cervix index. Close supervision is imperative during treatment. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if unintentional hyperstimulation occurs.\nFurther remarks concerning the steps to be taken when ovarian hyperstimulation has occurred can be found under Actions.,Infertility, Assisted reproductive technologies, Polycystic ovarian disease, In vitro fertilisation procedures,Females: Pregnancy, enlargement of the ovaries or cysts that is not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome, gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause and tumors in the uterus, ovaries and breasts.\nMales: Carcinoma of the prostate and tumors in the testes.\nThe following conditions must be properly treated before therapy with HMG is begun: Dysfunctions of the thyroid gland and of the cortex of the suprarenal gland, a rise in the serum level of prolactin with different causes (hyperprolactinaemia), tumors in the pituitary gland (hypophysis) or in part of the diencephalon (hypothalamus).,Unless prescribed otherwise, doses are as follows: Sterility in Females: The dosage of HMG for the induction of follicle growth in normo- or hypogonadotrophic women varies according to the individual. The amount depends on ovarian reaction and should be checked by ultrasound examinations of the ovaries and measuring estradiol levels. If the HMG dosage is too high for the treated individual, multiple uni- and bilateral follicle growth can occur. HMG is administered IM or SC and in general, the therapy is begun with a daily dosage corresponding to 75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH daily. If the ovaries do not respond, the dosage can slowly be increased until a rise in estradiol secretion and follicle growth is evident. Treatment with the same dosage of HMG continues until the preovulatory estradiol serum level is attained. If the level rises too quickly, the dosage should be reduced. To induce ovulation, hCG 5000 or 10,000 IU are injected IM 1-2 days after the last HMG administration. Note: After administering a HMG dosage which is too high for the corresponding individual, a subsequent hCG administration can cause an unintentional hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Sterility in Males: Initially, 3 x 1000 and 3000 IU hCG a week are administered until a normal testosterone serum level is reached. Then, an additional dose of HMG 3 x (75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH)/week is administered IM for a few months.,Occasionally, nausea and vomiting can occur.\nIn single cases, hypersensitivity reactions and fever can occur during treatment with HMG. The administration of Menogon may lead to reactions at the injection site: Reddening, pain, swelling and itching. In very rare cases, long-term usage can lead to the formation of antibodies, making the therapy ineffective.\nTreatment with HMG can often lead to ovarian hyperstimulation that first becomes clinically relevant after the administration of hCG (pregnancy hormone) to induce ovulation. This can lead to the formation of large ovarian cysts that tend to rupture and to intra-abdominal bleeding.\nIn addition, the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavity (ascites), the accumulation of fluids in the chest cavity (hydrothorax), a decrease in the excretion of urine (oliguria), lowering of the blood pressure (hypotension), and occlusion of blood vessels by blood clots (thromboembolic phenomena) can occur. Treatment should be immediately discontinued when the first signs of hyperstimulation appear: Abdominal pain and a palpable (by the physician) enlargement in the lower abdomen, which can be detected sonographically.\nIf abdominal pain occurs, see the doctor.\nWith pregnancy, these side effects can intensify, continue over a long period of time, and be life threatening.\nUnintentional multiple pregnancies occur more often during treatment with HMG.,5,Menotrophins, a purified extract of human post-menopausal urine, contain follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) in a ratio of 1:1. The biological effectiveness of menotrophins is mainly due to its FSH content. In the ovaries, the FSH-component increases the quantity of growing follicles and stimulates their development. Under the influence of LH, FSH increases oestradiol production in the granulosa cells. In the testes, FSH induces the maturation of Sertoli cells and the seminal canals and the development of the spermatozoa.,Increased follicular response with clomiphene citrate. Higher dose of menotrophin needed when gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist is used for pituitary desensitisation.

2161,Monobasic Sodium Phosphate + Diabasic Sodium Phosphate,Patients should be instructed to drink 8 ounces of clear liquids with each 4-tablet dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Patients should take a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids with monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Inadequate fluid intake, as with any effective purgative, may lead to excessive fluid loss, hypovolemia, and dehydration. Dehydration from purgation may be exacerbated by inadequate oral fluid intake, vomiting, and/or use of diuretics.\n\nPatients should be instructed not to administer additional laxative or purgative agents, particularly additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or enema products.\n\nProlongation of the QT interval has been observed in some patients who were dosed with sodium phosphate colon preparations. QT prolongation with sodium phosphate tablets has been associated with electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since serious complications may occur. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients with known prolonged QT.\n\nAdministration of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets may induce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, since this endoscopic finding was observed with other sodium phosphate cathartic preparations. In the monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets clinical program, aphthous ulcers were observed in 3% of patients who took the 48 gram monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets dosing regimen. This colonoscopic finding should be considered in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nBecause published data suggest that sodium phosphate absorption may be enhanced in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in such patients.,Cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy, Foods and water treatment,Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with biopsy-proven acute phosphate nephropathy.\n\nMonobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to sodium phosphate salts or any of its ingredients.,The recommended dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing for adult patients is 32 tablets (48 grams of sodium phosphate) taken orally with a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids in the following manner: \n\nThe evening before the colonoscopy procedure: Take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 20 tablets.                     \n\nOn the day of the colonoscopy procedure: Starting 3-5 hours before the procedure, take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 12 tablets. \n\nPatients should be advised of the importance of taking the recommended fluid regimen. It is recommended that patients receiving monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets be advised to adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets.  \n\nPatients should not use monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing within seven days of previous administration. No additional enema or laxative is required, and patients should be advised NOT to take additional agents, particularly those containing sodium phosphate,Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported with the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Dizziness and headache were reported less frequently. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, diarrhea was not defined as an adverse event in the clinical studies. Table 2 shows the most common adverse events associated with the use of 48 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, 60 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, and 60 grams of Visicol in the colon preparation trials (n=931).,3,NULL,NULL

People 2 years through 64 years of age who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease (e.g., those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection, or other immunocompromising conditions) should also receive PPSV23.\n\nPrimary Immunization: One 0.5 mL inj is sufficient to provide protection against the pneumococcal serotypes contained in the vaccine.\n\nRevaccination: One 0.5 mL inj must not be given within 5 years except in very high-risk subjects or patients under immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nAdministered intramuscularly or subcutaneously only.\n\n,Local Reactions at the Injection Site: Pain, erythema (redness), induration and oedema (swelling). These reactions are mild and transient. Rare reactions eg, Arthus phenomenon (severe local reactions) are reversible without after-effects; they mainly occur in subjects with high initial levels of pneumococcal antibody. Moderate and transient hyperthermia (fever) sometimes >39°C which generally occurs very shortly after vaccination and resolves within 24 hrs.\nOther General Reactions: Adenopathy (inflammation of the lymph nodes), rashes, arthralgia (pain in the joints) and allergic reactions [urticaria, Quincke'soedema (type of urticaria with sudden swelling of the face and neck), anaphylactoid reactions (severe allergic reaction)], headache, muscle pain, malaise, and fatigue have exceptionally been reported.,3,S. pneumoniae capsular antigens stimulate active immune response resulting in production of endogenously produced antibodies,Reduce immune response to Zostavax.

2324,Purified Soybean Oil,Intralipid should be given with caution in conditions of impaired lipid metabolism as in renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, impaired liver function, hypothyroidism (if hypertri-glyceridemic) and sepsis. If Intralipid is given to patients with these conditions, close monitoring of the serum triglyceride concentration is obligatory.\n\nThis medicinal product contains soya-bean oil and egg phospholipids, which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut.\n\nIntralipid should be given with caution to neonates and prematures with hyperbilirubinemia and cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In neonates, particularly prematures on long term parenteral nutrition, platelet count, liver tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored.\n\nIntralipid may interfere with certain laboratory measurements (bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, oxygen saturation, Hb etc) if blood is sampled before fat has been adequately cleared from the blood stream. Fat is cleared after a fat free interval of 5-6 hours in most patients.,Parenteral fat emulsions, essential fatty acid deficiency, Parenteral nutrition.,Intralipid is contraindicated in patients with acute shock and in patients with severe hyperlipemia. Severe liver insufficiency. Hemophagocytotic syndrome. Hypersensitivity to egg-, soya- or peanut protein or to any of the active substances or excipients.,1g triglycerides corresponds to 10 ml Intralipid 10%.\n\nAdults. The recommended maximum dosage is 3 g triglycerides/kg body weight/day. Within this upper limit, Intralipid can be given to contribute up to 70% of the energy requirements, also in patients with highly increased energy requirements. The infusion rate for Intralipid 10% should not exceed 500 ml in 5 hours.\n\nNeonates and infants. The recommended dosage range in neonates and infants is 0.5-4 g triglycerides/ kg bw/day. The rate of infusion should not exceed 0.17 g triglycerides/kg bw/hour (4 g in 24 hours). In prematures and low birthweight neonates, Intralipid should preferably be infused continuously over 24 hours. The initial dosage should be 0.5-1 g/kg bw/day followed by a successive increase by 0.5-1 g/kg bw/day up to 2g/kg bw/day. Only with close monitoring of serum triglyceride concentration, liver tests and oxygen saturation may the dosage be increased to 4 g/kg bw/day. The rates given are maximum rates and no attempt should be made to exceed these in order to compensate for missed doses.,Intralipid infusion may cause a rise in body temperature and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence<1%).,0,NULL,NULL
2326,Tetanus toxoid (Absorbed Tetanus) Vaccine,Do not administer IV. Use subcutaneous route in bleeding disorders. Withhold vaccination in moderate or severe febrile illness. Pregnancy, lactation, history of Guillian-Barre syndrome.,Active immunisation against tetanus, Postexposure prophylaxis of tetanus,It is a contraindication to use this or any other related vaccine after a serious adverse event temporally associated with a previous dose including an anaphylactic reaction. A history of systemic allergic or neurologic reactions following a previous dose of Tetanus Toxoid is an absolute contraindication for further use. \n\nIf a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid -containing preparations exists in a person who has not completed a primary immunizing course of tetanus toxoid and other than a clean, minor wound is sustained; only passive immunization should be given using TIG (Human). \n\nElective immunization should be deferred during the course of any febrile illness or acute infection. A minor afebrile illness such as a mild upper respiratory infection should not preclude immunization. Elective immunization procedures should be deferred during an outbreak of poliomyelitis. \n,Primary immunization for persons 7 years of age and older: A series of three doses of 0.5 ml each, of adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given intramuscularly; First dose: At appropriate date, Second dose: 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose, Third dose: 6 to 12 months after the second dose.\n\nChildren older than 7 years who did not complete primary immunization series (e.g., previously received only two doses of DTaP or DTP) need to receive only one dose of tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine to complete the primary series of tetanus.\nInterruption of the recommended schedule with a delay between doses does not interfere with the final immunity achieved with adsorbed tetanus vaccine. There is no need to start the series over again, regardless of the time elapsed between doses.\n\nRoutine booster injections: To maintain adequate protection, a booster dose of 0.5 ml of adsorbed tetanus vaccine every 10 years thereafter is recommended.\n\nVaccination of injured persons:\nClean and minor wound: \n•\tIf primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, no need of additional vaccine.\n•\tIf primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.\n\nAll other dirty wounds (contaminated with feces, soil, and saliva): \n•\tIf primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.\n•\tIf primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml along with tetanus immunoglobulin required.\n\nIf a person has no previous vaccination or uncertain, the primary series of 3 doses of 0.5ml adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given along with tetanus immunoglobulin with 1st dose.\nProtection of neonatal tetanus\nFor prevention of neonatal tetanus, adsorbed tetanus vaccine is recommended for immunization of women of childbearing age.\n \nFor pregnant woman who have not had previous immunization, 2 doses of tetanus toxoid at four weeks interval preferably during the last two trimester or at least 2 weeks before delivery should be given during pregnancy so that protective antibody would be transferred to the infant in order to prevent neonatal tetanus. e.g. 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 6th month of pregnancy and 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 7th month of pregnancy.\n\nPregnant woman who have completed the course of tetanus, next 10 years no need of additional dose during pregnancy. Thereafter a single booster dose would be sufficient to extend immunity.\n,Mild inj site reactions eg transient swelling, rash, fever, malaise, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, pruritus, dizziness.Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions. ,3,Tetanus toxoid adsorbed induces active immunity to the tetanus antigen by stimulating the immune system to produce specific antitoxin. They are not indicated for the treatment of active tetanus infection.,Decreased immunologic response with concurrent immunosuppressants. Neutralisation of tetanus immune globulin and tetanus toxoid adsorbed if not given at different sites using different syringes.
2327,Typhoid polysaccharide Vaccine,Not for treatment of typhoid fever. Vaccination may not provide full proetction thus, travellers should be advised to take all necessary precautions to avoid contact or ingestion of potentially contaminated food or water sources. IM admin: Caution when used in patients with a history of bleeding disorders, patients on anticoagulant treatment or severely immunocompromised patients. Pregnancy, lactation.,Prevention of typhoid, Active immunisation against typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi.\n,The vaccine protects against typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi. Protection is not conferred against paratyphoid fever or illness caused by non-invasive Salmonella. Typhoid vaccine should not be administered to subjects with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or to subjects having shown signs of hypersensitivity after previous Typhoid vaccine administration, or after any other vaccine containing Vi polysaccharide Salmonella typhi antigens. \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved. The administration of Typhoid vaccine should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness.\n,Intramuscular\nActive immunisation against typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi\nAdult:  Initial: 0.5 ml, to be given at least 2 wk before expected exposure. Booster immunisation: Repeat dose every 3 yr if exposure continues.\n\nChild: >2 yr: Initial: 0.5 ml, to be given at least 2 wk before expected exposure. Booster immunisation: Repeat dose every 3 yr if exposure continues.\n\nElderly: Initial: 0.5 ml, to be given at least 2 wk before expected exposure. Booster immunisation: Repeat dose every 3 yr if exposure continues.,Most recepients of Typhoid vaccine experience some reactions upon vaccination. These are generally moderate and short in duration. They mainly consist of local reactions at the injection site (erythema, induration and tenderness). Systemic reactions (malaise, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, myalgia and elevated temperature) are reported less commonly. In very rare cases allergic type reactions (pruritus, rash, urticaria) may be observed.,3,Live attenuateTY21a strain lacks enzyme UDP-4-galactose epimerase, which causes lipopolysaccharide to be synthesized under conditions that induce bacterial autolys; the avirulent strain produces enough lipopolysaccharide to evoke a protective immune response. Conveys active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies,Concurrent use with antibiotics or immunoglobulins may reduce the efficacy of typhoid vaccine. Mefloquine may increase the efficacy of typhoid vaccine. May reduce the diagnostic effect of tuberculin tests.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use with immunosuppressants may increase the adverse effects of live vaccines.
2331,Rabies Vaccine (Human) BP, Possibility of immune complex reaction 2-21 days after booster doses of HDCV (Human diploid cell cultures rabies vaccine); symptoms include arthralgia, arthritis, nausea, malaise, angioedema, fever and vomiting.

Intramuscular injections to be given on Day 0, D3, D7, D14 and D28 subsequent to contact with an animal confirmed or suspected of being rabid. In case of severe (WHO category 3) wounds, immunoglobulin should be administered as soon as possible. \n\nFully vaccinated individuals: If vaccine administered in less than 5 years of exposure (cell culture rabies vaccine): 2 injections on D0, D3. If vaccine administered in more than 5 years of exposure or incomplete vaccination: 5 injections on D0, D3, D7, D14 and D28 with administration of immunoglobulin if required. Post exposure vaccination must be administered on the basis of severity under medical supervision.\n\nIntradermal schedules: One intradermal (ID) dose is comprised of 0.1 ml.\nWHO Modified Thai Red Cross (2-2-2-0-2) schedule: Day 0: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites, Day 3: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites, Day 7: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites, Day 28: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites.\n\nTo reconstitute the vaccine, transfer content of supplied diluent into the vial containing freeze-dried preparation. Do not shake. After reconstitution the solution should be homogeneous, clear and free from any particles. Vaccine must be injected immediately after reconstitution and the syringe should be destroyed after use. \n,Minor local  reactions like pain, erythema, oedema, pruritus and induration at the injection site and lasting to 24-48 hours. Moderate fever, shivering, fainting, asthenia, dizziness, respiratory manifestations (dyspnoea, wheezing), fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and allergic skin reactions (urticaria, rash, itching). ,3,Rabies vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine that is used for active immunisation against rabies. It can be used for pre- and post-exposure immunisation. For post-exposure immunisation, it is often used in conjunction with rabies immunoglobulins as it takes about 7-10 days for the specific antibodies to develop.,Concurrent use with immunosuppressants may reduce the efficacy of vaccines.

Children under 4 years of age: ask a doctor. ,Cardiovascular\n\nCardiovascular side effects have included elevations of heart rate and blood pressure. In smaller doses, racepinephrine has caused peripheral coronary arterial vasodilation, but in larger doses, racepinephrine has caused diffuse vasoconstriction. This has caused increased peripheral vascular resistance, which was important in patients with coronary artery disease (worsened myocardial ischemia/angina) or hypertension (risk of emergent hypertension/stroke).\n\nArrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in patients with underlying cardiac disease. Rapid rises in blood pressure have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease.\nGastrointestinal\n\nGastrointestinal side effects have included nausea and vomiting.\nNervous system\n\nNervous system side effects have included fear, agitation, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, headache, tremor, dizziness, lightheadedness, nervousness, sleeplessness, excitability, weakness, and increased parkinsonian tremors.\nPsychiatric\n\nPsychiatric side effects have included agitation, disorientation, impaired memory, aggressive or assautive behavior, hallucinations, and psychosis.,0,Racemic epinephrine works by stimulation of the ?-adrenergic receptors in the airway with resultant tightening of the mucosa (mucosal vasoconstriction) and decreased fluid in the airway (subglottic edema) and by stimulation of the ?-adrenergic receptors causing relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle.,NULL

The dose may be increased at 4- to 8-week intervals according to individual patient requirements to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-I levels may be used as guidance in dose titration.\n\nAlternatively, taking into account recent literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15-0.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-I concentrations. During therapy, the dose should be decreased if required by the occurrence of adverse events and/or serum IGF-I levels above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person.\n\nA lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men.

2342,Recombinent Human Luteinising Hormone (Lutropin alpha),Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.\nIt should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained eg, ovarian failure, malformation of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy or fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.\nIn addition, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency and hyperprolactinemia and, pituitary or hypothalmic tumors, and appropriate specific treatment given.\nPatients undergoing follicular growth stimulation are at increased risk of developing hyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular development.\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome can become a serious medical event characterised by large ovarian cysts which are prone to rupture. Excessive ovarian response seldom gives rise to significant hyperstimulation unless hCG is administered to induce ovulation. It is therefore prudent to withhold hCG in such cases and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or use barrier methods for at least 4 days.\nCareful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound is recommended prior to and during stimulation therapy, especially in patients with polycystic ovaries.\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.,Female infertility,  (LH) and FSH deficiency,Hypersensitivity to gonadotropins or to any of the excipients of Luveris.\nOvarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma; active, untreated tumors of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland; ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease; gynecological hemorrhages of unknown origin.\nUse in pregnancy & lactationThis should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation.,Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. A recommended regimen commences at lutropinalpha 75 IU (ie, 1 vial of Luveris) daily with FSH 75-150 IU.\n\nIf an FSH, dose increase is deemed appropriate; dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any 1 cycle to up to 5 weeks.\n\nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5000-10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hrs after the last Luveris and FSH injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.,General Description: Lutropin alpha is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alpha. In this context, it is difficult to attribute adverse reactions to any one of the substances used.\nThere is considerable post-marketing safety experience with human luteinizing hormone (hLH)-containing medicinal products of urinary origin. The safety profile of Luveris is expected to be very similar to that of urine-derived hLH, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions and application site disorders.\nIn a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or swelling) were reported in 7.4% and 0.9% of the injections, respectively. No severe injection site reactions were reported. To date, no systemic allergic reactions have been reported following Luveris administration.\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed in <6% of patients treated with Luveris. No severe OHSS was reported.\nEctopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.,0,Luteinizing hormone binds to a receptor shared with the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) on the ovarian theca (and granulosa) cells and testicular Leydig cells. This LH/CG transmembrane receptor is a member of the super-family of G protein-coupled receptors. Adenylate cyclase then activates many other pathways leading to steroid hormone production and other follicle maturation processes.,Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin ? for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.\n\nIncompatibilities: Luveris must not be mixed with other medicinal products except follitropin ?.

It also helps facilitate nerve and muscle performance as well as normal cardiac function. Bone mineral component; cofoactor in enzymatic reactions, essential for neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and many signal transduction pathways. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble sterol. It is necessary for the regulation and regulation of calcium and phosphate homoeostasis and bone mineralisation. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and Vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention.,May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels. Bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride should be given at least 3 hr before calcium-containing preparations.

Clinical efficacy of desvenlafaxine is thought to be related with the drug's potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. It does not have monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity; and has not shown significant affinity for muscarinic cholinergic, H1-histaminergic, ?-adrenergic, dopaminergic, ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and opiate receptors in vitro. At concentrations that inhibit serotonin and norephinephrine reuptake, inhibition of dopamine reuptake appears to be unlikely.,Desvenlafaxine may diminish the therapeutic effect of Iobenguane I-123. May enhance adverse effects of other CNS depressants. Sibutramine and MAOI may enhance the serotonergic effect of Desvenlafaxine; increase risk of development of serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use with alpha-/beta-agonists may enhance tachycardic and vasopressor effect. Desvenlafaxine may increase concentration of CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine); decrease exposure of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) may increase concentration of desvenlafaxine. May enhance the antiplatelet effect of nonselective NSAIDs, aspirin; and anticoagulant effect of warfarin.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAOIs may lead to fatal serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions. Do not use within at least 14 days of discontinuing MAOI treatment and start MAOI at least 7 days after stopping desvenlafaxine. Increased risk of serotonin syndrome with sibutramine.
2772,Eslicarbazepine,Suicidal ideation\nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic active substances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\nNervous system disorders\nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.\nOral contraceptives\nEslicarbazepine acetate may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended\nOther warnings and precautions\nIf Eslicarbazepine is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential of increased seizure frequency.\nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may cause overexposure to the active metabolites.\nHyponatraemia\nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of patients treated with Eslicarbazepine. Hyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms like worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia increased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease leading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may themselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels should be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum sodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium levels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant hyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued.\nPR interval\nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.\nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac conduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation.\nRenal impairment\nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is not recommended due to insufficient data.\nHepatic impairment\nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic and clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n,Partial-onset seizures,Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients.

2773,Insulin Degludec,Insulin Degludecs must not be injected into a vein (intravenously) or a muscle (intramuscularly) and must not be used in infusion pumps.\n\nThere is no experience with Insulin Degludec in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.,Diabetes Mellitus,Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.Hypoglycaemia, Hyperglycaemia, Eye disorder.,Adult: S/C: Insulin Degludec is ultra long-acting basal insulin for once-daily at any time of the day, preferably at the same time every day.\nInitiation:\nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:\nThe recommended daily starting dose is 10 units followed by individual dosage adjustments.\n\nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus:\nInsulin Degludec is to be used once-daily with meal-time insulin and requires subsequent individual dosage adjustments.\n\n\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Insulin Degludec can be administered alone or in any combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists and bolus insulin.\n\nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, Insulin Degludec must be combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin to cover mealtime insulin requirements.\n\nOn occasions when administration at the same time of the day is not possible, Insulin Degludec allows for flexibility in the timing of insulin administration. A minimum of 8 hours between injections should always be ensured.\n\nPatients who forget a dose, are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily dosing schedule.\n\nSpecial populations:\n\nElderly patients (> 65 years old):\n\nInsulin Degludec can be used in elderly patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment:\n\nDegludec can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n\nPaediatric population:\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Insulin Degludec in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n\n,Hypoglycemia, Lipodystrophy & Reactions at the site of injection may occur. \nRarer side effects include: Hypersensitivity, Urticaria, Peripheral oedema\n,2,Insulin lowers blood glucose levels. It regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, and enhancing peripheral glucose disposal. The various insulin formulations are classified according to their durations of action after SC Inj. They are divided into short-, intermediate-, or long-acting insulin. Soluble insulin (also known as 'neutral insulin' or 'regular insulin') is a short-acting preparation. To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV. Compared to SC inj, IM admin usually has a faster onset of action, with a shorter duration of action.,Possible absence of hypoglycaemic warning symptoms with ?-blockers.

Do not exceed the stated dose. Not recommended for children less than 12 years of age.,Abdominal pain or distension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, borborygmi, flatulence, anal discomfort, headache. Rarely, allergic reactions.,0,Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives.\n\nPotassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.\n\nSodium bicarbonate raises blood and urinary pH by dissociation to provide bicarbonate ions, which neutralises the hydrogen ion concentration. It also neutralises gastric acid via production of carbon dioxide.\n\n Polyethylene glycol : Osmotic laxative; causes water retention in stool, causing increase in stool frequency.,NULL

It blocks alpha-1 adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck, resulting relaxation of these adrenoceptors in the bladder neck and prostate. Thus, there is an improvement in urine flow rate and reduction in symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Dutasteride inhibits 5 alpha-reductase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth.,Concomitant admin with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (eg. fluoxetine) or CYP34A (eg. ketoconazole, cimetidine) increases tamsulosin serum concentration; increase in blood concentrations of dutasteride in the presence of inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, verapamil, diltiazem, cimetidine, troleandomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
2778,Ticagrelor,General Risk of Bleeding: Drugs that inhibit platelet function including Ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding. \nConcomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose: Use of Ticagrelor with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of Ticagrelor. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Ticagrelor with a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. \n\nModerate Hepatic Impairment: Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. \n\nDiscontinuation of Ticagrelor: Discontinuation of Ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and death. ,Prevention of thrombotic events [cardiovascular death (CV), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke] in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) [unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)]; including patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).,History of Intracranial Hemorrhage: Ticagrelor is not recommended in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to a high risk of recurrent ICH in this population.\n\nActive Bleeding: Patients with active pathological bleeding eg, peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nSevere Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment because of a probable increase in exposure, and it has not been studied in these patients. Severe hepatic impairment increases the risk of bleeding because of reduced synthesis of coagulation proteins. \n\nHypersensitivity (eg, angioedema) to ticagrelor or to any of the components.,Initiate treatment with 180 mg (two 90 mg tablets) oral loading dose. Continue treatment with 90 mg twice daily. \n\n After the initial loading dose of Aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Ticagrelor with a daily maintenance dose of Aspirin should be of 75-100 mg. \n\nACS patients who have received a loading dose of Clopidogrel, may be started on Ticagrelor. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. A patient who misses a dose of Ticagrelor should take one 90 mg tablet (next dose) at its scheduled time.,Bleeding, Dyspnea, Other side effects (Headache, back pain, nausea, dizziness, cough, hypotension, fatigue, Atrial fibrillation). ,3,Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation.

2784,Insulin degludec + Insulin aspart 70/30 premixed,Hypoglycaemia\nOmission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Concomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose.\n\n\nHyperglycaemia\nAdministration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to hyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement.\n\nEye disorder\nIntensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups\nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between Ryzodeg and other insulin products.\n\nOlder patients (? 65 years old)\nRyzodeg can be used in older patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n\nPaediatric population\nRyzodeg has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation of pharmacokinetic properties.

When needed, the patient can change the time of administration as long as this insulin is dosed with the largest meal when taken once daily.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus this insulin can be administered alone, in combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, and in combination with bolus insulin.\nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, this insulin is combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals.\nThis is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient’s needs. Dose-adjustments are recommended to be primarily based on fasting plasma glucose measurements.\n\nInitiation\nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended total daily starting dose is 10 units with meal(s) followed by individual dosage adjustments.\nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended starting dose is 60–70% of the total daily insulin requirements. This is to be used once-daily at meal-time in combination.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nThiss insulin can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n,The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia.  \nImmune system disorders\nWith insulin preparations, allergic reactions may occur. Immediate-type allergic reactions to either insulin itself or the excipients may potentially be life-threatening.\nWith Ryzodeg, hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, tiredness and itching) and urticaria were reported rarely.\n\nLipodystrophy\nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions.\nInjection site reactions\nInjection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with\nRyzodeg. These reactions are usually mild and transitory and they normally disappear during continued treatment.\n\n,2,Insulin degludec and insulin aspart binds specifically to the human insulin receptor and results in the same pharmacological effects as human insulin.\n\nThe blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following the binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver.\n,NULL

Pregnancy & lactation.,Bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,Hypersensitivity to indacaterol, glycopyrronium or to any of the excipients of  Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler.\nUse in children: This should not be used in patients <18 years.,(Indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide) is a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).\nRecommeded Dose: One capsule once daily.\nIndacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler is recommended to be administered at the same time of the day each day. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. Patients should be instructed not to take >1 dose in a day.\nSpecial Populations: Renal Impairment: This Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis it should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk. \nHepatic Impairment: This Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data available for the use of Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore caution should be observed in these patients.\nElderly: Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in elderly patients (?75 years).\nAdministration: For inhalation use only. The capsules must not be swallowed.\n,Upper resp tract infection; nasopharyngitis, UTI, sinusitis, rhinitis; dizziness, headache, cough, oropharyngeal pain including throat irritation, dyspepsia, dental carries, gastroenteritis, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia & chest pain.,16,When indacaterol and glycopyrronium are administered together in this Breezhaler, they provide additive efficacy due to their different mode of action targeting different receptors and pathways to achieve small muscle relaxation. Due to the differential density of ?2-adrenoceptors and M3-receptors in central versus smaller airways, ?2-agonists should be more effective in relaxing small airways while an anticholinergic compound may be more effective in large airways. Thus, for optimal bronchodilation in all regions of the human lung, a combination of a ?2-adrenergic agonist and a muscarinic antagonist may be beneficial.\nIndacaterol: Indacaterol is an 'ultra' long-acting ?2-adrenergic agonist for once-daily administration. The pharmacological effects of ?2-adrenoceptor agonists, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP, cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has >24-fold greater agonist activity at ?2-receptors compared to ?1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to ?3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol.\nWhen inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a nearly full agonist at the human ?2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, indacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action.\nGlycopyrronium: Glycopyrronium is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) for once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Parasympathetic nerves are the major bronchoconstrictive neural pathway in airways and cholinergic tone is the key reversible component of airflow obstruction in COPD. Glycopyrronium works by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby dilating the airways.\n,Decreases levodopa effects. Effects may be enhanced by using drugs with antimuscarinic properties or MAOIs concurrently. May antagonise the GI effects of cisapride, metoclopramide and dompeidone.\nPotentially Fatal: IV admin in the presence of cyclopropane anesth can result in ventricular arrhythmias.

Their mechanism of action is based on an inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis. Tetracyclines block the access of the bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome, thus preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain in protein synthesis. When given at therapeutically attainable concentrations their toxic effect is limited to the bacterial cells.\n\nThe exact mechanisms by which tetracyclines reduce lesions of acne vulgaris have not been fully elucidated; however, the effect appears to result in part from the antibacterial activity of the drugs. Following oral administration, the drugs inhibit the growth of susceptible organisms (mainly Propionibacterium acnes) on the surface of the skin and reduce the concentration of free fatty acids in sebum. The reduction in free fatty acids in sebum may be an indirect result of the inhibition of lipase-producing organisms which convert triglycerides into free fatty acids or may be a direct result of interference with lipase production in these organisms. Free fatty acids are comedogenic and are believed to be a possible cause of the inflammatory lesions, e.g. papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, of acne. \n\nHowever, other mechanisms also appear to be involved because clinical improvement of acne vulgaris with oral tetracycline therapy does not necessarily correspond with a reduction in the bacterial flora of the skin or a decrease in the free fatty acid content of sebum.,Oral retinoids (risk of intracranial HTN). Reduced absorption by Fe prep & antacids. Increased risk of haemorrhage w/ coumarin anticoagulants. Decreased digestive absorption w/ didanosine.

Therapy should be initiated as early as possible after the first signs and symptoms.,The following most common adverse reactions (&lt; 1%) were local skin reactions like drying or flaking of the skin; burning or tingling, erythema; pigmentation changes, application site reactions including signs and symptoms of inflammation.,2,Aciclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of Aciclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts Aciclovir into Aciclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. \n\nIn cell culture, Aciclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. \n\nHydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is used topically for its anti-inflammatory effects which suppress the clinical manifestations of the disease in a wide range of disorders where inflammation is a prominent feature.\n,NULL
